# Vision API: Barcode Scanner

__[Why this project exists?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33371331/how-to-get-detected-barcode-qr-automatically/33450716#33450716)__

This project is based on the [Google Vision Barcode API](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vision). The Barcode Scanner API detects barcodes in real time in any orientation. You can also detect and parse several barcodes in different formats at the same time. The API supports the following barcode formats:

# 1D barcodes: 

- EAN-13 
- EAN-8
- UPC-A
- UPC-E 
- Code-39
- Code-93
- Code-128
- ITF
- Codabar

# 2D barcodes: QR Code, Data Matrix, PDF-417, AZTEC

It automatically parses QR Codes, Data Matrix, PDF-417, and Aztec values, for the following supported formats:

- URL
- Contact information (VCARD, etc.)
- Calendar event
- Email
- Phone
- SMS
- ISBN
- WiFi
- Geo-location (latitude and longitude)
- AAMVA driver license/ID
